The code contained within this subpackage obviously 'ruins' the Euler problems, for those who would attempt them.
Look at this code only at your own risk! I believe in open source, but as a movie fan (and a person who respects a good
riddle), I hate spoilers even more, so don't let me ruin these for you!

The problems are arranged in subpackages that contain 25 problems each. They all have an annotation (@Euler) that
specifies problem number and problem name, for a likely later webpage of some kind. The problem itself is always copied
into the class Javadoc comments.

For the rest of the problems, see projecteuler.net
